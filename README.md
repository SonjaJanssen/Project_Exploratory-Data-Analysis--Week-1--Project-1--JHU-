## This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository,
#  a popular repository for machine learning datasets.
#  In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power 
#  consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

## UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php


#  Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb] is downloaded

#  Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a 
#  one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. 
#  Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
#_______________________________________________________________________________
#  The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

## https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption


#  1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

#  2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

#  3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

#  4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

#  5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

#  6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

#  7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
#     It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave 
#     (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

# 8.  Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
#     It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, 
#     a refrigerator and a light.

# 9.  Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).
#     It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

##                           1.  Loading the data
#_______________________________________________________________________________
# When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:
  
# - The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate
#   of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. 
#   Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).

# - We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. 
#   One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading 
#   in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.

# - You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes
#   in R using the      strptime()  and  as.Date() functions.

# - Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

#                          2. Making Plots
#_______________________________________________________________________________

# Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies 
# over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following 
# plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

# First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: 
# https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

##  For each plot you should:

# - Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

# - Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

# - Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs 
#   the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. 

#   Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can
#   be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.

# - Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository
#   (no need for separate sub-folders)

# - When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub 
#   so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. 
#   There should be four PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files 
#   in the top-level folder of the repo.

##  The four plots that you will need to construct are described in the course instructions

#                             GOOD LUCK!
